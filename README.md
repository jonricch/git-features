GitHub is a powerful tool for developers to showcase their work and collaborate with others. One of the key features of GitHub is the ability to create a personal website, known as a GitHub Page, to showcase your projects. Through GitHub Pages, you can display your portfolio, blog about your coding journey, and even host a personal resume. This not only allows you to showcase your work in a professional manner, but it also provides a platform for others to discover and appreciate your skills. In short, the ability to showcase projects through GitHub Pages is a valuable tool for any developer looking to establish their online presence and showcase their skills to the world
